Check if your octave-headers package is properly installed by running 
compiling test.cc as described in make.sh. 

These packages where needed on my Ubuntu machine:
libtool automake libboost-python-dev libopenmpi-dev  octave  octave3.2-headers

When octave-headers is properly installed it is fairly easy to 
install pytave as described in e.g. install-pytave. But 
there is a bug in the most recent changeset so revert to changeset
51.      

bzr branch lp:pytave
cd pytave
bzr revert -r 51
autoreconf --install
./configure
sudo python setup.py install



If you have trouble with MPI when running make.sh, you may   

bzr branch lp:pytave 
cd pytave 
bzr revert -r 51
export CC=mpicc 
export CXX=mpic++ 
autoreconf --install
./configure 
sudo python setup.py install
